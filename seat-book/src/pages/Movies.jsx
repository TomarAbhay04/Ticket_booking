            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                The history of movies dates back to the late 19th century, with the invention
                of motion picture cameras and the development of celluloid film. Early pioneers
                like Thomas Edison and the Lumi√®re brothers contributed to the emergence of
                filmmaking as a new art form.

                In the early 20th century, silent films became popular, featuring iconic stars
                such as Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton. The 1920s saw the transition to
                synchronized sound, revolutionizing cinema with classics like "The Jazz Singer."

                The Golden Age of Hollywood in the 1930s and 1940s produced legendary films and
                stars, including "Gone with the Wind" and actors like Marilyn Monroe and Humphrey
                Bogart.

                Post-World War II, cinema diversified with the rise of international filmmaking
                and genres like film noir, leading into the New Hollywood era of the 1960s and
                1970s. This period saw the emergence of directors like Martin Scorsese and
                Francis Ford Coppola.

                transforming blockbuster filmmaking with franchises like "Star Wars" and "Jurassic
                Park." Meanwhile, independent cinema flourished, offering alternative voices and
                narratives.
